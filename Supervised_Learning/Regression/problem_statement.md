# Problem Statement: Predicting Hiring Costs and Time-to-Fill for Companies

Hiring and retaining employees are critical aspects of business operations, but they also pose significant challenges in terms of cost, time, and resources. According to statistics, small business owners spend a considerable portion of their working hours on non-income-generating tasks like hiring, while companies allocate a substantial percentage of an employee's salary towards recruitment efforts. Additionally, the process of onboarding a new hire incurs a loss in revenue due to the time it takes for them to become fully productive.

To address these challenges, we aim to develop a predictive model that can estimate the costs associated with hiring a new employee and the time it takes to fill a vacant position. By leveraging historical data on hiring activities, employee salaries, and time-to-fill metrics, our model will assist companies in budgeting and planning their recruitment efforts more effectively.

## Objectives:

1. Develop a predictive model to estimate the costs of hiring a new employee based on company size and other relevant factors.
2. Build a model to forecast the time it takes to fill a vacant position, considering historical hiring data and job characteristics.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommendations to help companies optimize their hiring processes and minimize recruitment costs.

## Data Sources:

- Historical hiring data, including the number of positions filled, time-to-fill metrics, and associated costs.
- Employee salary information.
- Company size and industry data.
- Additional variables such as job role, location, and recruitment channels.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Accurate predictions of hiring costs and time-to-fill metrics for different types of companies and job roles.
- Insights into the factors influencing recruitment expenses and hiring timelines.
- Recommendations for streamlining the hiring process and optimizing resource allocation.

By developing predictive models for estimating hiring costs and time-to-fill, we aim to empower companies with data-driven insights to make informed decisions and enhance their recruitment strategies. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the efficient allocation of resources and improved workforce management practices.
